# Time-Is-Money-Clip
made in 4 days

The building system is pretty janky, I'd use a grid with an array as a controller if I had time, but this was made in 4 days including making all the assets and stuff.
I'm mostly proud of my texturing and technical art in this as I used a super low poly count for everything that had to be spawned a lot and used only one texture with about 10 pixels for everything with an unlit shader.
If i had more time I maybe would have implemented object pooling for the clips but thankfully the game still runs smoothly without it.
